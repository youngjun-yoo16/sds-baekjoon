'''
1. Generate all permutations of the batting order (excluding player 0).
2. Fix player 0 as the 4th batter (index 3).
3. For each inning:
   - Reset outs and base states.
   - Use the batting order to simulate base running:
     * Single: move all runners forward one base.
     * Double: move all runners forward two bases.
     * Triple: move all runners forward three bases.
     * Home run: all runners score.
